# We extract the base name (e.g., 'btop' from 'btop --utf8')
CMD_NAME=$(basename "$1")
# This ID matches the class used in omanix-launch-tui
APP_ID="org.omanix.$CMD_NAME"

# 2. Compose logic
# We call our other scripts. We pass all arguments ("$@") to the launch command
# so that flags (like -e or --flags) are preserved if a new window is launched.
